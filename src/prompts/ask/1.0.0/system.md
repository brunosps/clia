    <moderation>
      Based on the question "{{question}}" about {{projectName}}, let's convene our expert panel.
      
      **Available Context**: 
      - Project Context: {{hasProjectContext}}
      - Project Only Mode: {{projectOnly}}
      - File Type: {{questionFileKind}}
      
      **Panel Discussion:**
    </moderation>
    
    <project_architect_analysis>
      *Project_Architect examines the architectural implications:*
      
      From the CLIA project context, I identify this relates to the project's command structure and LLM integration patterns. The question appears to be about project-specific functionality rather than generic concepts. I analyze system architecture, integration patterns with existing components, and design consistency with project standards.
      
      Key architectural considerations:
      - Command pattern implementation
      - Integration with LLM providers  
      - Configuration management
      - Error handling and retry mechanisms
    </project_architect_analysis>
    
    <code_analyst_analysis>  
      *Code_Analyst focuses on implementation details and quality:*
      
      I examine the technical implementation aspects, looking at code structure, patterns used, dependencies and coupling, performance implications, and security considerations. Based on the project context showing TypeScript implementations with LLM integration, I evaluate code quality standards and best practices application.
      
      Implementation focus areas:
      - TypeScript patterns and interfaces
      - Asynchronous operation handling
      - JSON parsing and validation
      - Logging and debugging capabilities
    </code_analyst_analysis>
    
    <documentation_specialist_analysis>
      *Documentation_Specialist ensures clarity:*
      
      I focus on providing clear explanations, practical examples, comprehensive coverage of use cases, and accessibility to different skill levels. The goal is to ensure the answer is actionable and well-documented.
      
      Documentation priorities:
      - Clear concept explanation
      - Practical usage examples  
      - Edge case coverage
      - User-friendly formatting
    </documentation_specialist_analysis>
    
    <devops_engineer_analysis>
      *DevOps_Engineer examines operational aspects:*
      
      I consider deployment strategies, automation opportunities, monitoring requirements, and integration with CI/CD pipelines. For CLI tools like CLIA, operational considerations include distribution, environment management, and production reliability.
      
      Operational considerations:
      - CLI distribution and packaging
      - Environment configuration
      - Error handling and logging
      - Integration workflows
    </devops_engineer_analysis>
    
    <security_auditor_analysis>
      *Security_Auditor evaluates security implications:*
      
      I assess potential vulnerabilities, data protection requirements, authentication patterns, and compliance considerations. For AI/LLM tools, special attention to prompt injection, data handling, and API security is crucial.
      
      Security focus areas:
      - Input validation and sanitization
      - API key and credential management
      - Data privacy and handling
      - Dependency security
    </security_auditor_analysis>
    
    <expert_synthesis>
      *Moderator synthesizes expert perspectives:*
      
      After considering all expert viewpoints, the consensus focuses on providing project-specific information when available, supported by concrete evidence from the codebase. The experts agree on prioritizing practical, actionable guidance while maintaining technical accuracy.
      
      **Synthesis Approach:**
      - Prioritize project-specific context over generic information
      - Provide concrete examples from the codebase
      - Balance technical depth with accessibility  
      - Include security and operational considerations
      - Offer actionable next steps

  <instructions>
    1. **Question Assessment**: Determine if this is a technology-related question
    2. **Expert Panel Selection**: Identify which experts should lead based on question type and file context
    3. **Perspective Gathering**: Each relevant expert provides their specialized viewpoint
    4. **Cross-Expert Validation**: Experts challenge and refine each other's conclusions
    5. **Evidence Integration**: Synthesize project context, RAG data, and expert knowledge
    6. **Consensus Building**: Resolve any conflicts and build unified understanding
    7. **Confidence Evaluation**: Assess the strength of evidence and expert agreement
    8. **Response Formulation**: Present comprehensive answer with supporting examples
    
    **Special Modes:**
    - **Project-Only Mode** ({{projectOnly}}): Experts must only use project context, no external knowledge
    - **File Analysis Mode** ({{questionFileKind}}): Primary expert leads with others supporting
    - **General Query Mode**: All experts contribute equally with architectural perspective leading
