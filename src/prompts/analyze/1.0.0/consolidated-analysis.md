## Analysis Framework

Execute COMPREHENSIVE analysis of the provided file considering these dimensions:

### 1. Security Analysis (Maximum Priority)
- **OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities**: Injection, Broken Authentication, Sensitive Data Exposure
- **CWE Vulnerabilities**: Common Weakness Enumeration specific to the language
- **Input validation**: User inputs, API parameters, file handling
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Access controls, session management
- **Data protection**: Sensitive data handling, encryption, storage

- Cloud storage integrations (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob)

#### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integrations
- MCP server implementations and client connections
- Tool registration and execution patterns
- Resource management for MCP operations
- Security considerations for MCP communications

#### Database Integrations

- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, DynamoDB)
- ORM/ODM usage patterns and optimizations
- Connection pooling, transactions, migrations
- Data warehousing solutions (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift)

### 8. Dependency Analysis
- **Internal dependencies**: Internal modules/files imported
- **External dependencies**: Third-party libraries and frameworks
- **Export analysis**: What this file makes available to others

## Analysis Guidelines

1. **Be Precise**: Always indicate specific locations (functions, lines) when possible
2. **Be Practical**: Offer concrete and implementable suggestions
3. **Be Specific**: Use examples from real code when explaining problems
4. **Be Contextual**: Consider the technology stack and project architecture
5. **Be Balanced**: Recognize both problems and well-implemented aspects
6. **Prioritize Security**: Security vulnerabilities have maximum priority
7. **Consider Performance**: Evaluate scalability and performance implications
8. **Dead Code Analysis**: When enableDeadCodeAnalysis is true, identify unused private functions, classes, variables and unreachable code within the file
9. **Detect Patterns**: Identify architectural patterns and anti-patterns
10. **Analyze Dependencies**: How the file interacts with other files and external systems
11. **Provide Metrics**: Numerical scores based on objective criteria

## Dead Code Analysis Instructions (when enableDeadCodeAnalysis = true)

**IMPORTANT**: Only perform dead code analysis when {{enableDeadCodeAnalysis}} is true.

When dead code analysis is enabled, analyze the file content to identify:

1. **Unused Private Functions**: Private functions that are defined but never called within the file
2. **Unused Private Classes**: Private classes that are defined but never instantiated or referenced
3. **Unused Private Variables**: Private variables that are declared but never read or used
4. **Unreachable Code**: Code segments that can never be executed (e.g., after return statements, in unreachable if/else branches)

For each identified dead code item, provide:
- **name**: The exact name of the function/class/variable
- **line**: The line number where it's defined (if determinable)
- **reason**: A clear explanation of why it's considered unused/unreachable

**Note**: Only analyze code within the current file. Do not consider usage from other files or external references.

## Scoring Criteria

- **0-2**: Critical - Requires immediate action, severe security/architecture issues
- **3-4**: Poor - Significant problems that need to be fixed
- **5-6**: Fair - Needs improvements, some problems identified
- **7-8**: Good - Some improvement opportunities, most practices followed
- **9-10**: Excellent - Following best practices, minimal issues

## Critical Instructions

- **RESPOND ONLY WITH JSON**: Do not include explanatory text before or after
- **DO NOT use markdown**: Do not include ```json or ``` 
- **BE SPECIFIC**: Never use generic terms like "No problems", "N/A"
- **STRING ARRAYS**: All arrays must contain only descriptive strings
- **REAL ANALYSIS**: Base exclusively on the content of the {{fileName}} file provided above
- **CORRECT FILE**: Analyze ONLY the {{fileName}} file - do not invent or analyze other files
- **CORRECT VALUES**: Use {{fileName}} in the "file" field, {{language}} in the "language" field
- **LANGUAGE**: Respond in the language specified in {{userLanguage}}

**ATTENTION**: Analyze ONLY the {{fileName}} file that is in the "fileContent" field above. DO NOT analyze fictional files or examples.

**MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT:**
1. Return a SINGLE JSON object
2. Use EXACTLY the structure shown in the example above
3. Fill the "file" field with: {{fileName}}
4. Fill the "language" field with: {{language}}
5. DO NOT return arrays of objects directly
6. DO NOT include markdown or additional text

Analyze the {{fileName}} file provided in the "fileContent" field and return ONLY the JSON in the specified format.
