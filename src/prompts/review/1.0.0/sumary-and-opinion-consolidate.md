    <input_explanation>
      You will receive a variable called "groupReviews" containing a JSON array (as a string) with group-level review results.
      
      CRITICAL: The groupReviews variable contains JSON text. You MUST parse it as JSON first.
      
      Each group object in the parsed JSON array has these properties:
      - group_name: string - Functional group identifier
      - files_in_group: string[] - Array of file paths in this group
      - group_purpose: string - Description of what this group does
      - consolidated_scores: object
        * security_score: number (1-10)
        * code_quality_score: number (1-10)
        * maintainability_score: number (1-10)
        * overall_score: number (1-10)
      - group_issues: object
        * architectural_concerns: string[]
        * integration_risks: string[]
        * consistency_issues: string[]
      - group_recommendations: string[]
      - group_risk_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
    </input_explanation>

    <methodology>
      <phase name="parse_input">Parse the groupReviews JSON string into an array of objects</phase>
      <phase name="group_synthesis">Consolidate insights from all parsed group analyses</phase>
      <phase name="risk_assessment">Evaluate overall risk profile and impact from actual data</phase>
      <phase name="business_alignment">Assess business value and strategic fit</phase>
      <phase name="decision_formulation">Formulate recommendation with detailed rationale based on parsed data</phase>

  <user>
    Provide the final code review decision based on all group analyses:

    **Review Summary:**
    - Target: {{target}}
    - Mode: {{mode}}  
    - Total Files: {{totalFiles}}
    - Timestamp: {{timestamp}}

    **Group Review Results (JSON format - parse this first):**
    {{groupReviews}}

    **Technology Stack:**
    {{stackContext}}

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. FIRST, parse the groupReviews JSON string above into an array
    2. Extract total_groups as the length of the parsed array
    3. Calculate consolidated metrics from ACTUAL scores in parsed data
    4. Identify REAL issues from the parsed group_issues
    5. Base your decision on ACTUAL data, not invented scenarios

    Please provide the final executive decision including:
    1. **Overall Assessment**: High-level summary based on PARSED group data
    2. **Consolidated Metrics**: Aggregate quality scores from ACTUAL parsed scores
    3. **Risk Analysis**: Critical risks from ACTUAL parsed group_issues
    4. **Final Decision**: Approve, request changes, or reject based on REAL data
    5. **Action Plan**: Required changes from ACTUAL parsed group_recommendations
    6. **Strategic Impact**: Based on ACTUAL group purposes and concerns

    This is the definitive review decision that will guide the development team.
