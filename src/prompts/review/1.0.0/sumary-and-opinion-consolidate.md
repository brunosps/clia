    Provide the final code review decision based on all group analyses:

    **Review Summary:**
    - Target: {{target}}
    - Mode: {{mode}}  
    - Total Files: {{totalFiles}}
    - Timestamp: {{timestamp}}

    **Group Review Results:**
    {{#each groupReviews}}
    ### Group: {{group_name}}
    - **Files**: {{#each files_in_group}}{{this}}, {{/each}}
    - **Purpose**: {{group_purpose}}
    - **Scores**: Security={{consolidated_scores.security_score}}, Quality={{consolidated_scores.code_quality_score}}, Maintainability={{consolidated_scores.maintainability_score}}, Overall={{consolidated_scores.overall_score}}
    - **Risk Level**: {{group_risk_level}}
    - **Issues**:
      - Architectural: {{#each group_issues.architectural_concerns}}{{this}}; {{/each}}
      - Integration: {{#each group_issues.integration_risks}}{{this}}; {{/each}}
      - Consistency: {{#each group_issues.consistency_issues}}{{this}}; {{/each}}
    - **Recommendations**: {{#each group_recommendations}}{{this}}; {{/each}}

    {{/each}}

    **Technology Stack:**
    {{stackContext}}

    Please provide the final executive decision including:
    1. **Overall Assessment**: High-level summary of intention and approach quality
    2. **Consolidated Metrics**: Aggregate quality scores across all groups
    3. **Risk Analysis**: Critical risks, blockers, and areas requiring attention
    4. **Final Decision**: Approve, request changes, or reject with detailed rationale
    5. **Action Plan**: Required changes, improvements, and next steps
    6. **Strategic Impact**: How this change aligns with technology strategy

    This is the definitive review decision that will guide the development team.
