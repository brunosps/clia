    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Review ONLY the specific changes shown in the diff below. Do NOT analyze unchanged code.**

    **File Being Modified:**
    - Path: {{filePath}}
    - Change Type: {{changeType}}
    - Language: {{language}}
    
    **DIFF - Focus ONLY on lines with + (additions) or - (deletions):**
    ```diff
    {{diff}}
    ```

    **Brief Context (for understanding):**
    {{summary}}

    **Technology Stack:**
    {{stackContext}}

    **Security Context:**
    {{securityContext}}

    **SIMULATION: Expert Panel Debate**

    Conduct a live debate between the 5 experts about the SPECIFIC CHANGES in the diff:

    1. **Dr. Sarah Chen (Security)**: Analyze security implications of the changes only
    2. **Marcus Rodriguez (Clean Code)**: Evaluate SOLID principles and clean code in modifications
    3. **Elena Kowalski (Architecture)**: Assess architectural impact of changes
    4. **James Kim (Performance)**: Review performance implications of modifications
    5. **Aisha Patel (Testing)**: Question testability of changes

    **Debate Format:**
    - Each expert presents their view on the CHANGES
    - Experts challenge each other's opinions
    - Identify specific SOLID violations in the modifications
    - Debate clean code compliance of the changes
    - Reach consensus on risk level and recommendations

    **Output Requirements:**
    - Analyze ONLY lines with + or - in the diff
    - Ignore unchanged code (lines without +/-)
    - Focus on what the developer CHANGED
    - Provide assessment in {{userLanguage}}
    - Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no extra text)
